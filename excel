Implemented Agile methodologies in sprint planning and automation team.
Established a Git CI/CD pipeline for secure code deployment, incorporating pre-commit code reviews to prevent vulnerabilities, such as hard-coded passwords.
Conducted a comprehensive analytics project monitoring disk metrics on physical servers, including I/O time, disk read/write time, average I/O write time, and queue size.
Developed a consolidated metric for disk health assessment by scaling composite scores obtained from dimensionality reduction.
Created a System Uptime graph in Grafana, providing a clear display of the current status with ICTO 5050.
Currently working on a memory usage composite function metric for a comprehensive memory health assessment.
ML/Ops Project and Automation:

Devised a Non-negative Matrix Factorization Cosine Similarity algorithm for an Incident Documentation Recommendation system, outperforming the existing TFIDF model.
Enhanced anomaly detection by making the weak prediction mechanism fault-tolerant and faster, preventing memory leakage.
Improved the fast prediction algorithm by processing data in parallel chunks, enhancing speed and fault tolerance.
Optimized the strong anomaly prediction algorithm, reducing time complexity in the fifth step of anomaly detection.
Conducted an Airflow POC to fetch passwords from CAPAM, integrating it with Winrm-operator for executing PowerShell and Bash/Shell scripts through airflow DAGS.
Automated account creation in Cleo Automation using Perl scripts, including password encryption and user account generation for Inbound and Outbound Accounts.
Configured CLEO secure SFT servers for Internal and External Clients, facilitating efficient file transfers during the account creation process.
Implemented automation using Eyeshare tool to streamline use cases like IRIS API, DM salt stack, and improved logic for disk cleanup, hardware monitoring scripts, enhancing security.
Implemented Eyeshare automation for password retrieval through the CAPA password retrieval API, reducing manual efforts and streamlining the password retrieval process.
Currently developing a POC for integrating osmosys, snow, dataone, moogsoft, control m, and ims API to create Eyeshare automations in Airflow.
Enhanced various workflow scripts in Eyeshare by optimizing complexity and length of queries in automation space, including disk cleanup and threshold management.
